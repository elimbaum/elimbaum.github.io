# about

I am an aspiring mad scientist who likes building things and solving puzzles.

I am currently an engineer at the U.S. Department of State. Professionally, I am interested in cryptography and privacy; embedded systems; and cellular networks.

Non-professionally, I like

- local news
- investigative podcasts
- remixes of songs that shouldn't be remixed
- public transit and urban planning
- modern design
- linguistics
- cooking
- running

I also volunteer with [Code for DC](https://codefordc.org/) and [Kitchio](https://kitchio.co/).
