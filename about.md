# [about]

<img src="/assets/img/eli.jpeg" class="img-right" alt="photo of eli"/>

I am an aspiring mad scientist who likes building things, breaking things, and solving puzzles.

My name is pronounced like `EEli bOWm`; rhymes with "we lie brown" but if there was an `m` at the end. (IPA: **ilaɪ baʊm**)

## work

I am interested in cryptography and privacy, embedded systems, and wireless communications, with a particular focus on cellular networks.

As of Fall 2023, I am pursuing my PhD at Boston University under [Mayank Varia](https://www.mvaria.com/) and [John Liagouris](https://cs-people.bu.edu/liagos/index.html). I am jointly a member of [BUSec](https://www.bu.edu/cs/groups/busec/) and the [CASP Lab](https://sites.bu.edu/casp/people/).

When I lived in DC, I volunteered with [Code for DC](https://codefordc.org/) on the [DARIA](https://www.dariaservices.org/) team. DARIA works with the [DC Abortion Fund](https://dcabortionfund.org/) and others to build and maintain their tech stacks, so funds can focus on their mission. We're on Github [here](https://github.com/DARIAEngineering/dcaf_case_management).
