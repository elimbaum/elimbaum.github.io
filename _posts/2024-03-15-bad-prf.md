title: "a bad pseudorandom function"

{% include math.html %}

Assume \\(G(s)\\) is a secure pseudorandom generator. Then (according to [Leo](https://www.cs.bu.edu/~reyzin/)) \\(F_k(x)=G(k\oplus x)\\) is _not_ a secure PRF. Why?

[^1]: Technically, whether \\(s>p/2\\).


## Warm up

The intuition here is that XORing the key and seed imparts some unacceptable structure on the PRF. This is easier to see if you consider addition, instead; \\(F'_k(x)=G(k+x)\\).

$$
\begin{align}
F'_k(x) &= G(k+x) \\
&=g^{k+x} \bmod p\ ||\ \beta(k + x)\\
&=g^k g^x \bmod p\ ||\ \beta(k + x)\\
\end{align}
$$

\\(\beta(k+x)\\) is not necessarily known, but if \\(x\\) is small, then \\(\beta(k + x)\approx\beta(k)\\) w.h.p. Let \\((z_L, z_R) = F'_k(0)\\). Then,

$$
F'_k(x) \approx g^x \cdot z_L || z_R
$$

So, given the evaluation of the PRF at zero (or really any fixed point), we can extract the value of the PRF for an arbitrary input, merely by multiplying by \\(g^x\\) (and maybe flipping the last bit, if \\(x\\) is large). Not good!

## Extending to XOR
The same idea works with XOR, but it's a bit more involved on the LHS. The right side is actually easy: \\(\beta(k\oplus x)=\beta(k)\oplus\beta(x)\\).

As above, let \\(
(z_L, z_R) = F_k(0) = G(k\oplus 0) = g^k \bmod p\ ||\ \beta(k)
\\). To handle the XOR, we need to consider the bitwise representation of the PRG: let \\(x_i\in\\{0,1\\}\\) be the \\(i\\)-th bit of \\(x\\). Then, \\(x=\sum_i 2^i x_i\\) and \\(g^x=\prod_i g^{2^i x_i}\\). We can expand the PRG construction as follows:

$$
\begin{align*}
g^{k\oplus x}&=g^{\sum_i(2^i[k\oplus x]_i)}\\
&=g^{\sum_i\left(2^i[k_i+x_i-2k_ix_i]\right)}&\text{algebraic representation of }\oplus\\
&=g^{\sum_i2^ik_i+\sum_i2^ix_i-2\sum_i2^ik_ix_i}\\
&=g^{k+x-2\sum_i2^ik_ix_i}\\
&=g^kg^xg^{-2\sum_i2^ik_ix_i}
\end{align*}
$$

Define \\(h=g^{-2}\\):

$$
\begin{align*}
F(k\oplus x)&=g^k g^x \prod_i h^{2^ik_ix_i}\bmod p\ ||\ \beta(k\oplus x)\\
&=z_L\left(g^x\prod_i h^{2^ik_ix_i}\right)\bmod p\ ||\ z_R \oplus\beta(x)
\end{align*}
$$

The adversary (trying to guess \\(F_k(x)\\)) already knows \\(z_L, z_R, \beta(x),g^x\\). The inner product is difficult so compute... but it is equivalent to \\(h^{k\wedge x}\\). So, we have an interesting attack: we only have to guess those bits of the key for which \\(x\\) also has a set bit; equivalently, given \\(F_k(0)\\), we can determine the evaluation of the PRF for low-weight \\(x\\).

Does this actually work?

## Implementing the attack

Yes! Some quick python code implements this attack, with the simulated success probability closely tracking the math. The meat of the attack looks like this:

```python
# A random x to look at
x = random.randint(1, 2 ** MAX_EXP)
# The rand() below is a random key. `guess` is our guess for k & x 
guess = rand() & x

# Left side of the PRG
newL = (zL * pow(gen, x - 2 * guess, P)) % P
# Right side
newR = zR ^ beta(x)

maybe_prf = (newL << 1 | newR)

####
## secret section
true_value = bad_prf(k, x)
is_correct = true_value == maybe_prf
#####

hw = x.bit_count()
```

We run the above in a loop, monitoring success probability binned by hamming weight. I used \\(p=4294967087\\) but of course, in reality, you would want a much larger group (the results hold for longer primes, but simulation takes significantly longer).

Vertical axis is \\(\log_{10}\Pr\\), so `-1` is 10%, etc. For hamming weight of 1 (i.e., \\(x\\) is a power of two), we succeed with probability \\(1/2\\). The dashed "theoretical" line is \\(\Pr[w]=2^{-w}\\). The results above were generated with 1M iterations of the attack.
